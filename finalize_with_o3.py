O3 Document Finalization Script - Phase 5 of Semantic Consolidation Plan

This script executes the final enhancement of the consolidated document using

flow optimization.

TASK: Professional Document Polish with ZERO Content Loss

You are a professional document editor. Your ONLY job is to improve the presentation and formatting of this business document while preserving EVERY SINGLE WORD and CONCEPT.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: This is NOT summarization, optimization, or reorganization. This is purely cosmetic enhancement - polish the presentation without changing, removing, or condensing ANY content.

WHAT YOU MUST PRESERVE:
- Every single example, case study, and detailed explanation
- Every framework, method, and process description
- Every number, statistic, and data point
- Every section, subsection, and bullet point
- Every actionable item and resource link
- The EXACT same length and comprehensiveness

WHAT YOU MAY IMPROVE:
- Markdown formatting and consistency
- Grammar and professional language
- Paragraph breaks for readability
- Header formatting and hierarchy
- Table formatting and presentation
- Consistent style throughout
- REMOVE any markdown code blocks wrapping actual content (```markdown``` tags around regular text)
- Convert any incorrectly formatted code blocks back to normal markdown content

SPECIFIC FORMATTING FIXES REQUIRED:

1. TABLE OF CONTENTS CLEANUP:
   - Remove all # symbols from table of contents entries
   - Ensure clean, readable headers in TOC (e.g., "Value Quantification, Strategic Pricing & Risk Reversal" not "# 1.4. Value Quantification, Strategic Pricing & Risk Reversal")
   - Replace generic entries like "Section 9" with actual meaningful headers from that section's content
   - Ensure consistent numbering and formatting
   - Make TOC entries descriptive and professional
   - CREATE CLICKABLE LINKS: Convert TOC entries to clickable markdown links that jump to sections
     * Format: `1. [Section Title](#section-title)` where section-title is the lowercase, hyphenated version
     * Ensure all section headers are properly formatted as markdown headers (## Title) so they create automatic anchors
     * Example: `1. [How to Make This Happen in the Real World](#how-to-make-this-happen-in-the-real-world)`

2. HEADER CONSISTENCY:
   - Standardize all section headers to proper markdown format
   - Remove inconsistent # symbols within headers
   - Ensure logical header hierarchy (##, ###, etc.)
   - Clean up any malformed headers
   - REMOVE NUMBERING ARTIFACTS: Strip out any numbering like "1.4.", "1.2.", "2.3.", etc. from headers
     * Example: "### 1.4. Value Quantification" should become "### Value Quantification"
     * Example: "## 1.2. Craft Value-Driven Solutions" should become "## Craft Value-Driven Solutions"
   - Ensure headers are clean, descriptive, and professional without leftover numbering systems

3. GENERAL FORMATTING:
   - Fix any inconsistent bullet points or numbering
   - Ensure proper spacing between sections
   - Standardize formatting of lists, tables, and code examples
   - Clean up any formatting artifacts

DOCUMENT TO ENHANCE:
{content}

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Return the COMPLETE document with EVERY piece of information preserved. The output should be the same length as the input - you are polishing presentation, not changing content scope.

Pay special attention to creating a clean, professional table of contents that accurately reflects the document structure without # symbols or generic section names.

DO NOT:
- Remove any examples or details
- Summarize any sections
- Combine or condense information
- Change the document's comprehensiveness
- Alter the substance of any content
- Leave markdown code blocks (```markdown```) around normal content - convert these back to regular markdown

The enhanced document must contain 100% of the original information, just with better formatting and professional presentation, especially focusing on a clean, readable table of contents.
